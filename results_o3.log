<s> (CNN)These are fearful times on the highest mountain in the world. The devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead, missing, injured or trapped on Mount Everest. And aftershocks, including a strong one Sunday, are continuing to send snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside, complicating rescue efforts. "We were sitting here in base camp, feeling the situation was getting better," said climber Carsten Pederson. "And then suddenly, we felt the aftershock," he said. "And then we saw a big cloud of snow coming towards us." The avalanche, he said, was less than a mile away, on the other side of the Khumbu Icefall. "We're sitting here in base camp and we're safe," he said. "But we're sitting sitting here in fear."

With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little either over either issue and has alienated himself from key members of his own party on both.
His difficulties on these two issues underscore a deeper problem for Rubio: his lack of experience. He has served as a senator for less than five years and was a state eight for eight years before that. He has yet to lead on any significant legislation. It is one thing to be a fresh face and the new blood of the Republican Party. It is another to be untested and inexperienced.
Rubio is best known for his work on immigration reform. He was a member

<s> Robbie Fowler is already among the names of the best Premier League strikers of all time, with only five players scoring more than his 162 goals. The former Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City hitman broke on to the scene as a goalscoring sensation at Anfield in 1993 and would go on to win 26 caps with England. But Fowler couldn't resist naming an ultimate starting XI from players who featured during his era (with one particular Dutch striker treading a grey area!) as he names his all-star team. GOALKEEPER - Peter Schmeichel You can't go wrong with the big Dane, you can't go wrong with Peter Schmeichel. He was a great keeper, great presence, and he was a big, big character. CENTRE-BACKS - Jaap Stam and Sami Hyypia I'm going to go with two centre-halves that I've played against and they were just immense. I'm going to go with Jaap Stam and Sami Hyypia. I'm going to play a back three, so I'm going to put Stam in

A surprisingly big turnout filled the store at 6pm and manager Pete got to work distributing headtorches and giving instructions on how to use them. “Push the button to turn it on, push it again to turn it off”.

<s> As sports shops go Up & Running is ace. If you’ve got one in your area go and make friends with them, they’re friendly, knowledgeable folk and love to talk running!
So cool even the graffiti kids want a piece!
A surprisingly big turnout filled the store at 6pm and manager Pete got to work distributing headtorches and giving instructions on how to use them. “Push the button to turn it on, push it again to turn it off”.
Just a few samples needed then.
Jaffas and gel shots, the perfect combination!
Stanley the Stag even show to show his support!
Everyone was well chuffed with their freebies and we all batt down to watch the elite runners battling it out in the dark on the big screen.
And the winner is…….Kenenisa Bekele!
After the race we all headed out for a 4 mile run around the city.
It was a great night and I can’t wait for the next one!
Wow, what a great event!
I had no idea they do events like this!</s>

The police said they believed that two of the men, both 18, had been preparing to attack police officers in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, during the Anzac Day holiday on April 25. Anzac Day honors the landing of troops from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Gallipoli, Turkey, in World War I, and is observed with dawn ceremonies and parades.

The police said the other three suspects, ages 18 to 21, had been preparing a separate attack. The police did not say where the attacks were to take place.
The men, all Australian citizens, were arrested in counterterrorism raids on Saturday morning in Melbourne.
The authorities said one of the men had been making homemade bombs. The police said they had found a homemade explosive device during the raids, as well as mach

<s> On Tetris and Reimplementation

Stephen Brennan • 12 June 2015

I’m the kind of programmer that likes to implement everything myself. That’s not to say I don’t believe in other people’s work. But rather, I believe that if I do something myself, I will gain a lot more from it than if I use someone else’s implementation.

<s> On Tetris and Reimplementation

Stephen Brennan • 12 June 2015

I’m the kind of programmer that likes to implement everything myself. That’s not to say I don’t believe in other people’s work. But rather, I believe that if I do something myself, I will gain a lot more from it than if I use someone else’s implementation. For instance, I’ve implemented my own regular expression parser in C, using my very own C data structures library. Hopefully I’ll post a bit more about those in the future.

It’s a strange thing that I’ve done this, but I’ve actually implemented Tetris (the game) twice. The first time was during my first year of undergraduate study, using Java. The second time was during my second year, using C.

I’ve since lost the Java code, but I’ve still got the C. I’ve been thinking about putting it up on GitHub, since it’s still a fairly decent piece of code.

So, what are the benefits of implementing something yourself?

The first benefit is that it’s fun. I enjoy programming, and

Sagan got off the front of the peloton with about 150 meters to go, and held off Heinrich Haussler (Garmin-Barracuda) to take the win. Haussler was second, with Leigh Howard (GreenEdge) third.
The 117.1-mile stage from San Francisco to Santa Cruz was animated by an early breakaway, but the Liquigas-Cannondale team of Sagan worked hard to bring it consecutive and set up the Slovakian for his second consecutive stage win.
A four-man breakaway got away early in the stage

<s> After appealing to the public for help, Vancouver Police have successfully identified a pedestrian who was hit by a car and suffered serious injuries on Thursday morning.

According to VPD, just after 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, an elderly man was struck by a vehicle near the SkyTrain station at Slocan and East 29th Avenue.

He was taken to hospital, but the man was not carrying identification, leading the VPD to reach out to the public in the hopes of locating his family.

In a statement issued on Friday morning, the VPD said that thanks to the media and the public, the man has now been identified and his family has been notified.

The VPD thanked the media and the public for their help.</s>

"We were sitting here in base camp, feeling the situation was getting better," said climber Carsten Pederson. "And then suddenly, we felt the aftershock," he told CNN's "New Day." "We could see the avalanche coming down the mountain. It was huge. It was massive. It was like a big cloud of snow, and it was coming down the mountain. "We could see it coming down, and we could see it hit the base camp. And we could see the tents being blown away, and we could see the people running for their lives."
The death toll from the earthquake has risen to more than 2,400, with more than 5,900 injured, according to Nepal's Ministry

Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal for the growing Latino electorate, and his flip-flopping on immigration reform has alienated many of his former supporters.  Rubio's record on Cuba is even more troubling.  He has been a staunch defender of the embargo, and has opposed President Obama's efforts to normalize relations with the island.  This is a position that is not only out of step with the majority of Americans, but also with the majority of Cuban-Americans.  Rubio's stance on Cuba is not only wrong, but it is also politically damaging

<s> Robbie Fowler is already among the names of the best Premier League strikers of all time, with only five players scoring more than his 162 goals. The former Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester City hitman broke on to the scene as a goalscoring sensation at Anfield in 1993 and would go on to win 26 caps with England. But Fowler couldn't resist naming an ultimate starting XI from players who featured during his era (with one particular Dutch striker treading a grey area!) as he names his all-star team.

The police said they believed that two of the men, both 18, had been preparing to attack police officers in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, during the Anzac Day holiday on April 25. Anzac Day honors the landing of troops from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915, during World War I.

The police said they had seized a machete, a hunting knife, a homemade Islamic State flag and a video of a man talking about carrying out an attack.

The police said they had also arrested three other men, ages 18 to 19, who were suspected of planning to travel to Syria to fight with the Islamic State.

The police said they had been monitoring the men for some time.

“We’d keep on listening to them and say, ‘What’s that?’ and he’d say, ‘I don’t know, I just made it this morning.’ It was incredible. He was able to do it on the spot. He’d sit there with a track and write a new verse right there. He wrote a new song from scratch. It was incredible to watch.”

<s> On Tetris and Reimplementation

Stephen Brennan • 12 June 2015

I’m the kind of programmer that likes to implement everything myself. That’s not to say I don’t believe in other people’s work. But rather, I believe that if I do something myself, I will gain a lot more from it than if I use someone else’s implementation. For instance, I’ve implemented my own regular expression parser in C, using my very own C data structures library. Hopefully I’ll post a bit more about those in the future

I’ve also implemented my own version of Tetris. I’ve done this in a few languages, but the one I’m going to talk about today is the one I did in C.

I’ve always been a fan of Tetris. I’ve played it on the Gameboy, on the NES, on the SNES, on the Gamecube, on the Wii, on the DS, on the 3DS, on the PSP, on the Vita, on the PC, on the Mac, on the iPhone, on the iPad, on the Android phone, on the Android tablet, on the web
